\title{Create a LOD Plot}
\usage{
calib_plot_lod(calib_obj, target, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{calib_obj}{A \code{lod} \code{list} object containing the output from the  \code{\link{calib_lod}} function.}

\item{target}{A character string containing a unique identifier for the target calibration curve to be plotted.}

\item{...}{Placeholder for further arguments that might be needed by future implementations.}
}
\value{
A LOD plot in the current plotting device.
}
\description{
The LOD plot shows the relative detection rates for each standard as well as the LOD model curve.
    This code has been modified and functionalised from the original
    by Merkes et al. (see references).
}
\details{
The LOD plot shows the relative detection rates for each standard as well as the LOD model curve.
    The 95% LOD is identified, and effective LODs with confidence intervals for analysing samples with
    multiple replicates are displayed. The logarithmic function that was used to determine the LODs is
    shown in the plot subtitle along with the p‐value for a lack of fit test on the model.

qpcr_lod <- calib_lod(data = calib_data, threshold = 0.35,
              lod.fit = "best", loq.fit = "best")
calib_plot_lod(calib_data, target = "706")
}
